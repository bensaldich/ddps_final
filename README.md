## Introduction
<p>
The widely-known social media platform TikTok was first launched in China in September 2016 under the name of Douyin (抖音). It reached global fame after November 2017 when it was merged with the already popular platform Musical.ly (ByteDance, n.d.). The app has now reached more than 1 billion active users, ranking as the fourth largest social media platform in the world (Davis, 2024). Its appeal stems from its originally unique format that allows users to watch (and post) very short videos accompanied by trending music in the endless For You Feed (FYF). This feed is governed by an extremely advanced algorithm, which is not only able to capture a user's demonstrated preference but also to actively test its own predictions of what a user might like (Hern, 2022).
  
Despite its success, TikTok has often made headlines due to contentious allegations linking it to the Chinese Communist Party. Just recently, on April 24, the United States (U.S.) President Joe Biden signed a bill calling for ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to sell its American subsidiary to a local company, under the threat of a ban. In response, TikTok sued the federal government on May 7, on the grounds of violating freedom of speech rights as granted by the First Amendment, starting a case which is likely to reach the U.S. Supreme Court (Isaac, 2024). Previously, TikTok was banned in India together with 58 other mobile apps, on the grounds of being “prejudicial to the sovereignty of India, defence of India, security of the state, and public order” (Press Information Bureau Delhi, 2020).

Furthermore, its sophisticated algorithm, like many others, has consistently raised concerns about its fairness. On paper, the app states eight guiding Community principles aimed at ensuring fairness and unbiasedness which include enabling free expression, championing inclusion, and being fair and just (TikTok, 2024). However, these ideal values do not seem to always translate to reality. Our study aims to test the self-proclaimed unbiasedness of TikTok, focusing on a specific subcommunity: BookTok.

BookTok is a popular hashtag under which users exchange their favourite books, provide advice, and make recommendations on what to read. Its popularity surged during the pandemic, and in November 2023, the BBC reported that “#BookTok has over 200 billion views on TikTok, the equivalent of everyone in the world viewing it 25 times.” (Ariyanayagam, 2023). Its significance is further underscored by some of its most prominent authors ascending to fame, eventually landing on the New York Times (NYT) Bestseller list, a trend corroborated by our own research. Moreover, major book retailers in the US, such as Barnes & Noble, are now explicitly dedicating sections in their stores to “BookTok famous” books (Stewart, 2021).

Our research was prompted by an article in "The CUT" magazine lamenting the lack of diversity among the authors who achieved fame through BookTok (McCall, 2022). The article argued that all the authors who gained prominence on BookTok were white, attributing this to inherent racial biases in TikTok's algorithm (McCall, 2022). Our study seeks to validate the existence of a disparity in the representation of white versus black authors in the BookTok section of TikTok. Therefore, the research question behind our study asks: _Does the TikTok algorithm display a preference for white authors and white influencers in the #BookTok subcommunity?_

The paper commences with a literature review, outlining the current understanding of BookTok's significance and examining assertions regarding racial biases in TikTok's algorithm at large. Subsequently, we elucidate our analytical methodology, delineating the data collection process and the tools and techniques employed for analysis. Our findings are then presented, beginning with an assessment of the racial and gender composition of authors and influencers within our sample, followed by a comparison with the demographics of the subset of authors that also appeared in the NYT bestseller list. Finally, we offer a discussion of our findings and draw conclusions based on our research.

## Literature Review
<p>
The availability of literature that explores racial biases in TikTok subcommunities and their broader influence is limited, and this subject merits further study. Studying the algorithmic biases embedded within TikTok and the #BookTok subcommunity can contribute to literature dedicated to explaining how and why authors and creators who identify as Biracial, Indigenous or a Person of Colour (BIPOC) are being marginalized in subcommunities. 

<p>
#BookTok A Disruptor of the Publishing Industry
  </p>

The emergence of the #BookTok subcommunity during the COVID-19 lockdowns throughout 2020 and 2021 has completely changed how authors market their books to reach new audiences (Barnett, 2023). What started as a small subcommunity for people to connect during a period of loneliness and social isolation has become so popular that the #BookTok hashtag has now grown to have over six billion reposts (Ariyanayagam, 2023). News outlets like The New York Times, The Guardian and the BBC have reported the swaths of young people coming into bookstores to buy titles of old but seemingly up-and-coming authors in adult fiction (science-fiction, romance and fantasy) that viewers saw on #BookTok (Harris, 2022). The #BookTok subcommunity has completely disrupted the entire publishing industry by putting the readers in charge of the market rather than the publishers and the authors. It has allowed certain authors to profit greatly from this new marketing tool. In a report on the U.S. book market, insights company Circana found that despite the three percent drop in publishing and sales volume in the U.S., sales of books in the fiction category increased by one percent. This indicates that, despite the general drop in sales, #BookTok might have had a positive impact on the sales in the fiction category (Chojnacki, 2024). Despite this newfound success, there is ambiguity about which authors benefit most. Colleen Hoover, a white, middle-aged female American author who has been publishing books since 2012, became famous in 2020 and has since sold more copies of her books than the bible (Alter, 2022). Between 2022 and 2024, most weeks, Hoover had one of her books listed under the Combined Print & E-Book Fiction Category on The New York Times Bestseller List (The New York Times, n.d.). As a member of this group Hoover is among one of the authors who has been able to profit from #BookTok immensely. However, there are questions about whether authors of colour and of different ethnicities have had the same success.  

In 2022, as #BookTok was changing the publishing industry, The Cut Magazine, published an article about the racial bias on #BookTok (McCall, 2022). It explained that most of the authors who have experienced success from #BookTok, like Colleen Hoover, are white (McCall, 2022). The article details how bookstores are seeing readers pick up books with a lack of racial or ethnic diversity in the characters and reports that the TikTok algorithm is responsible for this discrepancy. Independent and new authors also found that in the early stages of #BookTok there was a lot of content from BIPOC authors, which has since been de-popularized (McCall, 2022). “It seems like the algorithm did drown out the POC authors and the readers as well” (McCall, 2022). The article also details how black creators on the platform do not get the same visibility unless they “stitch” a video of a white creator (McCall, 2022). The popular media and news outlets referenced above report evidence-based conclusions that are by no means empirical or academically rooted. A preliminary analysis of the evidence embedded within this discussion indicates that the recommendation system TikTok is using for the platform might have contributed to a racial bias and influenced the publishing market through #BookTok.

The Sensitivity of the TikTok Algorithm and Folk Theories on #BookTok
  </p>
The idea of online book reviews is not a new concept. Platforms such as Goodreads and Amazon have allowed users to upload and share reviews long before #BookTok became a popular medium for this exchange to take place. However, other platforms like TikTok, such as Instagram or Facebook, do not seem to have the same culture that #BookTok has fostered on TikTok. In their work, Taylor and Choi (2022) compare the perceived algorithm responsiveness (PAR) and perceived algorithm insensitivity (PAI) on Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter. They also hypothesize that PAR predicts content satisfaction levels. They found that TikTok was the most sensitive and responsive to users. This result helps to explain why the perception of an algorithm on TikTok allows users to control it more, giving them the power to partially understand their choice of videos (Taylor & Choi, 2022). In addition to perceptions of sensitivity and responsiveness, there has been some discussion in the literature about why #BookTok might have emerged on TikTok instead of other platforms. Bhandari and Bimo’s (2022) study, through a qualitative analysis of TikTok users, offers three main factors: the awareness of an algorithm, the volume of content and lack of context, and the creation of their own experience on TikTok (Bhandari & Bimo, 2022). Of these three factors, the latter two are most interesting. These findings question the ways in which TikTok predicts exactly what users seek and how much users create their own experiences. This study may help to explain the encoded biases in the TikTok algorithm that present users with an opportunity to connect with white authors versus authors who identify as BIPOC.

The Emergence of Racial Biases on TikTok or Statistics? 
  </p>
The first reports of racial biases on TikTok appeared in 2022 when National Public Radio (NPR) in the U.S. published an article about TikTok’s shadow banning of non-white creators (Kung, 2022). NPR reported that black creators who used tags like #BlackLivesMatter on their videos were censored, and some videos received zero views (Kung, 2022). After NPR’s report, TikTok acknowledged and apologized for what it termed a “glitch,” explaining this technical issue was also impacting other hashtags, including #cat and #dog (Shead, 2020). The reports in this article were empirically investigated by academics when Harris et al. (2023) conducted semi-structured interviews with twelve black creators. The researchers found that black creators had the largest problems with TikTok moderation and suppression, and authors who conducted interviews “that common perceptions held by Black creators of the algorithm are that it lacks transparency and filters our marginalized identities from being shown to a wide audience” (Harris et al., 2023). Two examples are worth sharing. First, some interviewees in the study indicated that if they used African American Vernacular English (AAVE), black creators might get sanctioned on TikTok for what it determines to be hate speech (Harris et al., 2023). This type of mislabelling and censorship acts as a barrier for BIPOC creators to reach audiences. Second, interviewees also indicated the presence of shadow banning, where videos were not formally reviewed by TikTok content moderators but placed in a grey area (Harris et al., 2023). Barriers like these have also led to greater difficulty with monetization, with creators indicating that upon comparing themselves to white viewers with similar account metrics, these individuals made more money per month.

“I can see the white creators who have less viewers than me…saying “here’s how I made 10,000 [dollars per month]... and they… will only have their account for a year… But me as a Black creator I’ve been here for three years and I’m not making nowhere near 10K…” (Harris et al., 2023)

In addition to the meaningful discussion on black creators, the discourse on viewer perception provides insights into how social media users define meaning. According to Melany Amarikwa (2023), who builds on Anita Allen (2022) and her concept of the “Black Opticon,” this concept theorizes how black people are surveilled and discriminated against on social media through what Allen terms “Discriminatory exclusion.” Defined as “excluding people of colour from beneficial opportunities based on race” (Amarikwa, 2023), discriminatory exclusion occurs when individuals or a platform aims to ensure people of colour (POCs) do not receive the same treatment or financial opportunities on the platform as their white and non-POC counterparts, excluding POC from beneficial opportunities based on race. The available literature about the impact of TikTok on diverse creator communities and the experience of the viewers who interact with them through their content indicates the presence of discrimination against BIPOC creators. Although limited and specific in scope, this literature highlights the presence of an issue that must be addressed and requires further investigation.

## Methodology
<p>
Though #BookTok is used across many languages and countries, our group’s interest in potential racial biases present in TikTok’s search results necessitated an in depth focus on one geographic location. Given the existing literature on racial disparities in the United States, and the emerging reports on BookTok’s racial bias in the American context, we aimed to collect primarily U.S. TikTok posts. To do so, a VPN was employed throughout the entire process of account creation and data collection, with an arbitrary location within the United States set to Phoenix, Arizona. Using the active VPN, a new TikTok account was created with a new email to mitigate the potential for data traceability. A selfie is required to authenticate new TikTok accounts. This selfie was taken by a member of our team (a white man). Aside from a few preliminary searches on the account, no other actions were performed on the account until our data collection commenced. Here are some screenshots of examples from our dataset:

Data collection was performed using the traffic monitoring Firefox extension, Zeeschuimer, paired with the auto-scrolling extension FoxScroller. Developed by the Digital Methods Initiative at the University of Amsterdam, Zeeschuimer allows users to collect data while they browse various social media websites, including Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and TikTok. Using Firefox Nightly in conjunction with the Arizona-based VPN, the new TikTok account was accessed. At this step, the Zeeschuimer extension was activated, and a search query was performed for #BookTok. Data collection was performed until no more results were offered. In total, 381 posts were collected, a small but meaningful sample when considering the team’s manual coding framework. 

Using 4CAT, Zeeschuimer’s companion data processing tool, data was converted from a .NDJSON format to a .CSV format. These data contained information on the post time, author, text body, as well as information on the account’s popularity and post-level engagement and viewership data. Surprisingly, these posts ranged from August 2021 to the time of data collection in April 2024, indicating that post-recency is but one of many factors present in TikTok’s search results algorithm. After collecting the data, a manual coding process was enacted, with coding performed across 7 categories (category-specific options provided in parentheticals):

- Whether the post was a review (non-reviews included viral book-themed trends that also employed #BookTook. Given their lack of relevancy, these data were excluded from further analysis)
- The sentiment of the review (Positive, Negative, or mixed)
- The perceived gender of the influencer (Male, Female, unable to tell)
- The perceived race of the influencer (White, Black, unable to tell)
- The name of the author of the first book reviewed in the post
- The name of the author of the second book reviewed in the post
- The name of the author of the third book reviewed in the post

Additionally, each author identified in the views was manually researched and labeled according to perceived race (White, Black, non-Black POC, mixed-race, or 'can't tell') and gender (female or male). Importantly, race and gender-based identifications for both the influencers and book authors were done using visual identification strategies, introducing the notable limitation that our results may be biased by incorrect labeling. This is particularly true when considering white-passing POC, mixed-race individuals, and/or individuals whose physical appearance do not conform to typical gender or racial divisions. This risk was partially mitigated by the inclusion of the 'can't tell' category, which was utilized under more ambiguous situations, but nonetheless presents notable limitations to our analysis. 

Once collected, data was cleaned, removing certain posts in different languages whose content could not be coded (n=3), as well as posts that were not viewable to those without a TikTok account (n=3).

To develop a comparison group, data from bestselling books on the New York Times Bestseller list were gathered using the New York Times book API. New York Times bestseller data was collected during two periods: in 2019, prior to the popularity of BookTok, and in 2024, when our BookTok data was collected. 

The resulting data contained three datasets: 1) our corpus of TikTok posts with our complete manual coding, 2) our author dataset, containing the authors mentioned in the posts alongside their perceived races and genders, and 3) our New York Times bestseller data. 

Various cross-sections of the data were analyzed, including the race and gender breakdowns of both the influencers recorded in our corpus, the equivalent breakdown of authors referenced by these influencers, and interactions between the race and gender of influencers and the books that they recommended.

## Results and Analysis
<p>
Our investigation into the TikTok community of #BookTok begins with an overview of what this community looks like and who its members are, starting from a descriptive analysis of our two datasets, the main one (booktok.csv) and the one focusing on the authors (booktok_authors.csv). 

Containing 381 scraped tiktoks, booktok.csv unfolds across 42 columns, some set up with Zeeschuimer (like "id" and "timestamp") and some by us (like "Is recommendation positive?" and "Is influencer white?). On the other hand, booktok_authors.csv presents the 353 that were mentioned/reviewed in the 381 tiktoks we analysed. The dataset contains information regarding race and gender of each author. 

Since #BookTok is a self-proclaimed digital book club, we were interested in seeing how many of the tiktoks containing the #booktok were actually book reviews. 

<img width="377" alt="2" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/02e0f2b6-1b35-41f0-b33e-f623b7534783">

As the graph above shows, indeed the majority of booktoks are reviews (262), but there still is a significant component that is not (111). 

Out of these reviews, almost the totality is positive:

<img width="414" alt="3" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/0a5ac3d7-5a53-4d79-a4dd-d325da79f908">


Almost 9 out of 10 reviews are positive in respect to the authors they showcase. Around 7% of the reviews fall under the "Yes and no" category, which indicates tiktoks that often displayed "most recently read books" kind of videos, including liked and disliked books.


We deemed interesting to locate in time the distribution of tiktoks to see if any interesting trend would emerge.


<img width="882" alt="4" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/b904f5d5-0077-4c36-9596-512cd3d95b3f">


From the collected sample, it seems like the number of booktok-related tiktoks has been increasing considerably since mid 2022 and has received a hit in the most recent months of 2024. This could be due to an increase in popularity of #BookTok or even of TikTok at large. Nevertheless, it is hard to generalise any finding due to the very limited scope of our data.

Looking at the words frequency distribution of booktoks captions: 

<img width="708" alt="5" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/f6a9ba1e-6663-45a4-a3a5-709780048d55">

It seems like versions of the word "booktok" are the most frequent components of tiktoks captions. The captions seem to be mainly made up of disaggregated hashtags, rather than coherent text.

As for the languages that the booktoks analysed were in:

<img width="757" alt="6" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/4ce1c8b0-504a-468d-a64d-269747e52d6a">


It is evident that the vast majority of booktoks analysed are in English.


After the analysis of a dozen of the tiktoks, it was already clear that the authors mentioned in the #BookTok community were rather repetitive. In fact some of the authors got extensively more coverage than others. This is in line with the "virality" concept of social media. 

<img width="762" alt="1" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/47e509c5-ef36-4517-a40f-03f838d70415">


Specifically, Colleen Hoover and Ana Huang seem to be the most frequently mentioned authors in the booktok community with 36 and 28 mentions respectively as the first three authors mentioned in a tiktok.


Now we can dive into the gender and race dimension of booktok!


<img width="362" alt="8" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/32c76d48-e354-4b39-9688-04a72e8961ac">


<img width="362" alt="8" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/4d4d2de8-6b4f-4d85-b81a-7c3892aebdd1">

The two pie charts above highlight how much the #BookTok community seems to be female-dominated both for the influencers and authors' sides. Female influencers take up an overwhelming 80.1% of the entirety of tiktoks taken in consideration. A similar percentage is reflected in the authors' category where "Non-male" authors amount at 80.2%. It is arguably more intersting to look at the male representation is both groups. Whilst for influencers they only reach 8.7%, male authors arrive at almost 20% of authors recommended on the platform.


We can perform a similar analysis to investigate racial bias on BookTok, the focus of our research.


<img width="362" alt="8" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/e9f792e1-f7c3-4501-b3f6-1c152b6a7d91">


<img width="362" alt="8" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/1a9e8abe-7710-4491-b40c-22277a2ae4bd">

(The "Can't Tell" section might be due to either the impossibility to differentiate an influencer's race or to the impossibility to see the influencer (e.g. videos without images of the influencer)). 

The "white component" seems higher for authors than influencers (82.2% vs 71.3%). Nevertheless, the "non-white component" is also higher for authors than influencers (16.4% vs 11.1%). This is due to a much smaller share of "Can't Tell" values for authors than influencers.


We can deepen our analysis by looking more closely at the racial composition of male and female influencers:


<img width="362" alt="8" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/19873e8b-a8c2-4854-b94f-34df7c8f3b04">


<img width="362" alt="8" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/f88bdced-e942-471f-97a9-30ac1fedafac">


We observe a pretty consistent racial composition across male and female influencers. Value count of "Can't Tell" seems to be the influencing factor in non-white share differences between the two pie charts.


Doing the same for authors: 

<img width="362" alt="8" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/06c671b9-fd80-4f7c-ae86-40371b5fe77d">


<img width="362" alt="8" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/97269ba3-fe71-43f5-adec-3e69402dd898">


Again, we notice consistent results for authors as well. 
Both for authors and influencers, irrespective of the gender, #BookTok appears to be a white-dominated community.



We are going to analyse if race plays a role in determining the attention and success that an influencer receives in the BookTok community. We are going to use the mean values of number of followers, likes and number of videos published by influencers categorising them by race.


<img width="426" alt="18" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/e4990e6c-3f28-4f58-b8af-f8a5e7443a02">


<img width="426" alt="18" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/fa686c79-2eaa-404f-99a3-7a5ca760c42a">


<img width="426" alt="18" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/f49cdce5-42bd-400b-ae23-87889a44805d">

The results obtained from the analysis of profile statistics by race seem to indicate that non-white authors tend to have on average significantly more followers and more likes. In terms of videos produced, the difference between white and non-white authors is instead not particularly relevant.

We are intersted in understanding if the results we got are driven by huge outliers or if they represent a general trend. We do it by utilizing boxplots for each of the three parameters, comparing results of white and non-white influencers.


<img width="465" alt="19" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/10195809-b1f6-4331-8e80-4cfc0da8ab25">


<img width="468" alt="19" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/51f49a79-4128-4033-a3ec-4c4d6194c487">



<img width="468" alt="19" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/1bf289b4-6080-426c-a428-4b0d167d685e">


<img width="468" alt="19" src="https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/50c70c4c-8647-4196-832c-51591179e907">



![23](https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/ce3a7aa0-bf31-468a-b4e6-a17b3727ef37)



![24](https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/166377571/47063252-dbc5-49a4-a0ca-9d8b16ce08d2)

Boxplots of the three categories seem to confirm the trend observed in the mean bar charts. For followers, likes, and videos, non-white influencers have more significant interquartile range than their white counterparts. It is also noteworthy to mention that actually outliers seem to be more common among white influencers across all three categories.   

Now we want to investigate if there is any correlation between the race of an influencer and the race of the authors they recommend. To do so, we will need to melt and merge the new_booktok and booktok_authors datasets for columns of interest, namely the ones indicating both influencer and author race.

We can now visualise if there is any trend relating the influencers' race to the authors' race. We are going to work on chi-square statistics and the p-value. We are going to assume that the variables (influencer race and author race) are independent and we are going to test for any discrepancies between their actual frequency distribution and their expected one.

Results of the chi-square statistic show that there is some level of discrepancy between the variables' frequencies (assuming they are independent). 
Nevertheless, the fact that the p-value is greater than normal (0.225 > 0.05) cannot make us reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between the variables. 
Hence, no substantial association between the influencer's race and the authors' they recommend race can be made.

In order to see further study the impact of booktok beyond the app itself, we want to compare the authors mentioned on booktok to those that are mentioned on the New York Times Best Sellers list.

We first use the Books API and make a function to get a list of the authors mentioned on the NYT best sellers list.

![image](https://github.com/bensaldich/booktok_decoding_biases_final/assets/150074790/6364351b-2272-417d-90e3-0c15589d5682)


Here we encountered a problem with the error message "429: Too many requests. You reached your per minute or per day rate limit". As displayed above, the rate limit of the API impacts the amount of data we were able to scrape from the best seller list in one request. We tried to add a delay between requests to avoid hitting the rate limit, but we still get some errors. As a result, we saved our results as a CSV file to store complete results and use those for our further exploration. 


Now, we want to get a list of the authors that were displayed on the best seller list for the first time since the beginning of booktok. We defined a function to print the names of the authors that appeared for the first time on the list between 2020 and 2023. Next, we we want to see how many of the newcomers have also been recommended on booktok.

Now, we are interested in seeing the racial distribution of authors on the NYT best seller list that have also been mentioned on booktok.

As seen above, the overwhelming majority of the newcomers that appear on booktok is white. This is consistent with the overall racial distribution of authors mentioned on booktok that we have seen before.

We then plot a similar figure to get a visual representation of the gender distribution.

Above we see the gender distribution of newcomers that are mentioned on booktok. Here, the male representation is higher than what we have seen on booktok. A possible explanation can be that the type of books these authors write have a broader audience and thus the male authors on booktok have proportionally greater outreach compared to female authors mentioned on booktok.

## Discussion
<p>
Our findings indicate that the BookTok subcommunity in the U.S., predominantly comprises White, female creators and authors. A thorough examination of influencer demographics in our sample reveals that 80.1% are women and 71.3% are white. Interestingly, non-white influencers tend to boast, on average, more followers, likes, and videos, as confirmed by boxplot interpretation.  We found no significant correlation between the race of influencers and of the authors they recommend.

A nearly identical gender distribution is observed among the authors mentioned in our sample TikToks, with 80.2% being women. However, the racial distribution appears more skewed, with 82.2% of authors being white. Black authors are notably underrepresented among both genders, comprising only 2.5% of female authors and 2.9% of male authors. Notably, the top 10 most recurring authors in our sample were exclusively non-black women, aligning with our expectation of significant racial disparities within the subcommunity.

Furthermore, the subset of authors that appeared in both our sample data and the 
NYT bestseller list reveals a similar racial distribution, with white authors comprising 77.8%. These findings seem to validate our thesis that the TikTok algorithm favours white authors, thereby boosting their book sales more than those of non-white authors. However, the possibility of a broader imbalance in the racial distribution of successful authors in the publishing industry remains plausible, warranting exploration in future studies.

Unexpectedly, when comparing the gender distribution of authors in our sample with those also appearing in the NYT bestseller list, we discovered a notable difference. While our sample skewed heavily towards female authors (about 4⁄5), the NYT subset demonstrated a much more balanced gender representation, with slightly over half being female. This suggests the underrepresentation of popular female BookTok authors in the NYT bestseller list (or an underrepresentation of successful male authors on BookTok), opening avenues for further investigation into potential gender bias in the TikTok algorithm.

However, our research is subject to certain limitations that may have an impact on our results. As outlined in the methodology section, one set of limitations arises from constraints related to the inability to automate the coding of authors mentioned in the TikToks within our sample. This constraint led to a relatively small sample size due to resource limitations, comprising less than 400 TikToks collected in a single session from one location and at one moment in time using a single account. Additionally, manual coding may have introduced errors stemming from human oversight or potential biases of the coders, particularly when inferring the race or gender of authors through visual analysis without additional online information. Moreover, the necessity of uploading a selfie (depicting a white male) to create the new account raises the possibility that this action may have inadvertently influenced the algorithm.

To bolster the robustness of our conclusions and address or mitigate these limitations, it would be valuable to replicate the study with a larger and potentially more diverse sample. This could involve collecting data from various locations and times, as well as using accounts with different characteristics and preferences. Furthermore, automating the coding process could significantly enhance the validity of the study.

Additionally, concerns regarding the comparability between BookTok and the NYT bestsellers list warrant attention. Our sample notably features a high frequency of romance or smut novels, which differs from the composition of the NYT bestsellers list, prompting questions about the potential impact of genre differences on our conclusions, and the comparability of these two datasets. Moreover, while we observed a clear correlation between popular authors on TikTok and those on the NYT bestsellers list, inferring causality is challenging. For instance, it is conceivable that some authors achieved fame outside of TikTok before appearing on the NYT list and subsequently gaining traction on BookTok. These considerations present avenues for further research, including comparisons between BookTok-famous authors and other success metrics such as Amazon book sales rankings.

## Conclusion
<p>
Our research was prompted by McCall's (2022) allegations regarding a racial bias in the TikTok algorithm, suggesting that it favoured white influencers and authors within the BookTok subcommunity, thereby boosting their book sales at the expense of non-white counterparts, particularly black individuals. Although broader claims of racial disparities within the platform were found in the literature, we found no concrete evidence supporting this specific assertion.
  
To investigate further, we created a new account to gather TikTok samples using the #BookTok hashtag. We then manually categorised the race and gender of influencers and the first three authors they mentioned. Additionally, we used inclusion in the NYT Bestsellers list as an indicator of fame.

Our findings generally align with the initial claim, revealing a predominantly female and white BookTok subcommunity, resulting in white authors more frequently achieving fame. While we can reasonably conclude a correlation between racial disparities in the BookTok subcommunity and the NYT bestsellers list, establishing a clear causal relationship remains challenging.

In summary, our analysis serves as an intriguing case study despite inevitable limitations due to resource constraints. It lays the groundwork for further research aimed at definitively determining the presence of racial bias in the TikTok algorithm, particularly within the BookTok subcommunity, and its potential impact on the careers of involved authors.
