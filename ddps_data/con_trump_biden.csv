0,F*ck you and Michael Rapaport if both of you are supporting Donald Trump.
1,"By the way, to those who wonder why so many Christians support Trump, this is why. Because no matter what he does or how he behaves, it pales in comparison to the evils being pushed on this country by the Democratic Party. Transgenderism at its core aims to distort human nature…"

1,"Fun fact: Over 90% of all voter fraud convictions are Republicans.
Trump and MAGA Republicans are literally building a fund to challenge the 2024 results - not a shred of decency in the entire party. Here’s another @GOP projection/admission: https://t.co/yRhRhZJG6T"
0,"The deep state, the blob, entrenched bureaucrats-I don’t care what you call them-rigged the 2020 election against Trump.
Uncomfortable with the word rigged?

Just use the term the left did in Time Magazine 4 months after Election Day. Fortified.
Rigged. Fortified. Same thing."
0,The justice department has proven to us that Trump is above the law. He will never be held accountable and there’s nothing we can do about it.
1,@lavern_spicer It's an abomination before God I'm talking to all Christians. Let's make Biden hear us loud and clear on Nov5. To let him know his time is èfç desecrated the office long enough.
0,"""Screw them Christian votes I don't need any of them"" - Basically, Joe Biden today. 

They wanted more visibility, and they have it for all the wrong reasons.

0,"Let’s do a test. If I posted something like trump posted about @JoeBiden how long would it take @FBI or @SecretService to contact me to have a chat. Since it’s trump, would they send his head of security “Tony Ornato &amp; Dawn” to “chat”?
Would Twitter suspend me? #2TieredJustice ⚖️ https://t.co/yULGpMBoQY"
0,Seeing things like this makes me fear that Trump may never actually be sentenced to prison even though he absolutely deserves it. Heck he deserved to be prosecuted in New York for financial crimes well before 2016.
